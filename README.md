# WeatherApp

Given list of city is limited to support the free version of the API. 

Improvements:
Can improve on the UI providing filter and sort functionality for the results shown
Can integrate user auth and provide the information of the data he has seen recently instead of selecting the cities again

On server side instead of using in-memory cache can use file cache so that data pertains even if server is down
